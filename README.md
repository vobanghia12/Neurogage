Completing the "Spin the Spectrum" challenge!
Introducing SpinBuddy!

SpinBuddy is a web application we built to help Spin the Spectrum and all their program participants better anticipate
each individuals' emotional needs by monitoring their heart rate. We developed this web app with a lot of funcationality in mind
such as the ability to monitor distress based on their heart rate and emotion recognition(to come soon in a future update).
This was developed to prioritize the safety and comfort of the Students and to help them in times of discomfort.
Our primary goal for this sprint was to focus on identifying triggers before they happen and logging data for the instructors to
review and in the future the next goal would be to research and implement a UI that would be succesful in helping the students.
